This program takes user input to initialize the size of the two matrices and uses Random to set the values in each matrix.
The program then writes both matrices into seperate text files called "matrix1.txt" and "matrix2.txt".
Next it takes the two matrices and multiplies them together to make a new matrix calles mtrx3.
It then takes mtrx3 and writes it in its own text file calles "matrix3.txt".
Finally the program prints out all three matrices into the standard output.
